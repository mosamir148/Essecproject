      "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about solar energy",
      "items": {
        "q1": "How long do solar panels last?",
        "a1": "Solar panels typically last 25-30 years, with most manufacturers offering 25-year performance warranties. The panels continue to produce electricity beyond this period, though at slightly reduced efficiency.",
        "q2": "What is the payback period for a solar system?",
        "a2": "The payback period varies depending on system size, location, and energy costs, typically ranging from 5-8 years. After this period, you essentially get free electricity for the remaining lifespan of the system.",
        "q3": "Do solar panels work in cloudy weather?",
        "a3": "Yes, solar panels can generate electricity even on cloudy days, though at reduced efficiency (typically 10-25% of full capacity). Modern panels are designed to capture diffused sunlight effectively.",
        "q4": "What maintenance do solar systems require?",
        "a4": "Solar systems require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning of panels (2-4 times per year) and periodic system inspections are usually sufficient. Most systems include monitoring to alert you to any issues.",
        "q5": "Can I go completely off-grid with solar?",
        "a5": "Yes, with an off-grid solar system that includes battery storage, you can achieve complete energy independence. This is ideal for remote locations or areas with unreliable grid access.",
        "q6": "How much roof space do I need?",
        "a6": "Typically, you need about 100-200 square feet per kilowatt of solar capacity. A 5kW system (average residential) requires approximately 300-400 square feet of roof space."
